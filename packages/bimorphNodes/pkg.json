{"license":"MIT","file_hash":null,"name":"bimorphNodes","version":"2.2.90","description":"BimorphNodes are a collection of powerful utility nodes that extend Dynamo for Revit.\r\n\r\nThe package includes ultra-efficient clash detection and geometry intersection nodes, which are enabling entirely new workflows in Dynamo by reducing processing time by up to 99.5% compared to current methods. The new clash and containment checking nodes can be found in the BoundingBox and Element classes.\r\n\r\nBimorphNodes extends Dynamos Revit.Elements.Element class with the exclusive LinkElement nodes, which comprise a range of methods that enable collection and interaction of elements from linked Revit models. The LinkElement class has been purpose-built to solve the transform limitation imposed by the Revit API, which restricts elements to their origin-to-origin position regardless of any transforms made to the associated link instance. LinkElement's have no such restriction, and are designed to position elements at their host location by default.\r\n\r\nFor DWG/DGN interop in Revit, there are nodes which convert curves from CAD links or imports using Layer Names as filters. Curves can be converted to Revit Model, Detail or Symbolic Lines without introducing unwanted CAD LineStyles into your project, and for enhanced workflows, each set of curves can be mapped to a LineStyle using the lineStyleMap input.\r\n\r\nThese CurveFromCADLayer nodes are optimised to convert more curve types than is currently possible with Explode in Revit or Revit.Elements.Element.Curves in Dynamo.\r\n\r\nThere are also nodes to duplicate sheets and any placed views, and new geometry nodes which extend Dynamos Curve class with new entirely functionality.\r\n\r\nPackage Nodes:\r\nCLASH DETECTION & ELEMENT CONTAINMENT\r\n- Element intersection with other elements - optimised for rapid results with massive datasets\r\n- Get all elements inside or intersecting a Bounding box (implements a Revit ElementQuickFilter for speed)\r\n\r\nCAD\r\n- Extract curves from CAD Links or Imports using layers as filters\r\n- Extract Detail curves from CAD Links or Imports using layers as filters\r\n- Extract Symbolic curves from CAD Links or Imports using layers as filters\r\n- Query layers in CAD Links or Imports\r\n- Report all CAD Links and Imports in a Revit or Family document\r\n- Set the colour and line weight of CAD (layer) Object Styles\r\n\r\nLINKELEMENT\r\n- Collect elements from a linked Revit model\r\n- Solves the linked element transform limitation imposed by the Revit API\r\n- LinkElements are located at their host location by default\r\n- Query the link elements associated transform and link instance ID\r\n- Get the link elements geometry and location at its host location\r\n- Optimised for use with BimorphNodes BoundingBox and Element nodes\r\n\r\nSHEET\r\n- Duplicate Sheets and placed Views \r\n- Renumber and/or rename Sheets \r\n\r\nCURVE\r\n- Remove duplicate curves\r\n- Find all intersections between a set of curves\r\n\r\nSCHEDULE\r\n- Extract table data from Schedules \r\n\r\nLINESTYLE\r\n- Create and query LineStyles\r\n\r\nCompatible with Revit 2016-2018.2 and Dynamo v1.2+\r\n\r\nIf you want to be the first to hear about the latest news and upcoming releases of BimorphNodes, you can follow us here:\r\n\r\nFacebook:  facebook.com/bimorphBIM\r\nLinkedIn:  linkedin.com/company/bimorph-bim\r\nTwitter:  @bimorphBIM\r\n\r\nBimorphNodes dictionary which includes user guides and example graphs:\r\nBimorphNodes:  bimorph.com/bimorph-nodes ","group":"","keywords":["bimorphnodes","bimorph","bi","bim","nodes","cad","layer","names","curves","filter","dgn","dwg","layers","duplicate","sheets","views","line","styles","new","linestyles","attributes","category","categories","get","schedule","table","work","data","column","row","lab","sheet","list","renumber","rename","re-number","re-name","archi","importinstance","import","instance","link","model","lines","use","modellines","delete","report","object","box","style","set","thomas","mahon","remove","detail","dynamo","dwg_dgn","re","name","number","audit","links","imports","clash","detection","containment","trim","curve","solid","bounding","intersect","element","intersects","inside","symbolic","avoidance","coordination","detective","interference","test","check","linkelement","transform","ofcategory"],"dependencies":[],"contents":"","engine_version":"1.2.0.2690","engine":"dynamo","engine_metadata":"","site_url":"https://bimorph.com","repository_url":"https://github.com/ThomasMahon/bimorphNodes","contains_binaries":true,"node_libraries":["BimorphNodes, Version=2.2.9.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null"]}
